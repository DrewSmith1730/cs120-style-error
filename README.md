# M1OEP-Style-Errors-asmith16
## Program
My main program allows the user to enter data for an employees An output will then tell the user what the expected paycheck of each employee will be

## Style
I prefer the style on the main branch simply because I prefer to use Camal case as my naming convention and the placement of brackets adds lines

## Errors
A compiler error i had to fix was my class files not being in my CMakeLists.txt file
An error i ran into was not being able to do user input directly for my enumerated type which i solved by adding an if statement to take the input and convert it
Through the use of the debugger I was able to find the logic error I made in implimenting getPayCheck
